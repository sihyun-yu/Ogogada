### Final Interface
#### Representative screenshots 
##### 1. Our Main Home Page
![](./Images/HOME.png)
You can check there are buttons for accessing to ranking page, game page, and tutorial pages.
##### 2. Game Page (in this screenshot, for level 1) 
![](./Images/GAME.png)
Some buttons are differentiated by color (HOT for red letters, ICE for blue letters) and timer, level status are denoted. Buttons for rechecking the task and go back button also exist. Users will do the task with the POS UI that several buttons are locked with their level.

After completing the task, user can choose to see the ranking or to go to home page. 
##### 3. Tutorial Page (in this screenshot, for level 2)
![](./Images/TUTORIAL.png)
Still, buttons are locked/unlocked and differentiated by color (such as HOT/ICE). The dialog before starting the tutorial says to follow the buttons with the red border, so that users can understand what to do. The 'red' letters of the instruction has 'red' color so that users can easily recognize by emphasis.

As explained, users can follow the instruction by clicking the buttons with red border.

If users want to go back to the home page, we reask user 'Are you sure?' to avoid accidental returning back. 
![](./Images/RANKING.png)
After accessing the ranking list page, users can know what they were supposed to do at the certain level and immediately check the winner of certain level.

By clicking the element of the list, users can know all 8 top players for each level. 
#### Quality arguments 
Our key idea to solve the problem is using gamification so that users can learn the POS so fast and efficiently. By lots of user testing during the semester and a lot of consideration among our team, we now can say our interface is great for a few reasons and successfully achieved our goals. For a better explanation, we will use figures uploaded on the above.

Since we wanted the process of learning POS looks very familiar to users, we tried to design and implement our homepage very similar to existing game home pages. There is an intuitive ranking button with the hand and arm holding a trophy. Plus, there 5 stages of game buttons and tutorial buttons, represented by door icons and ladder icons, respectively. While showing a demo to our classmates, many people said our home page looks friendly so that learning POS using our UI doesn't feel so hard for the first time. Especially, for parts of tutorial and game mode buttons, we focused on Affordance. As user level increases, ladder (denoting tutorial mode for each level) appears for users next level to lead to click the ladder button before doing the game mode of an increased level. Rather than separating all of the tutorial modes on independent one button, this increased users' affordance. Plus, an overall interface that users face also make them all processes doing tutorial then game look all connected. Lastly, game mode buttons that the user can access are differentiated by color which is easily recognizable. 

Now, let's focus on pages for our main solutions. First, focusing on the game mode page. There are POS UI which is familiar with us. There are some convincing arguments on this page. We first differentiated some buttons by color (HOT for red and ICE for blue) so that users can easily memorize and access to the button, and eliminating the confusion among these buttons. This is NOT the feature that original POS UI have, so we expect users to learn the POS easier with our interface rather than practicing the POS using the original POS interface. Plus, there are some locked buttons. These buttons enable users to focus on frequently used few buttons at the first time so that they can memorize and get familiar with these at the very beginning of the process, and make users want to open rest of locked buttons, so users feel the process of learning with more fun. Lastly, users can recheck the task and continuously check their time while finishing the task at a certain level, so users can feel learning POS just like a game.

Now, focusing on the tutorial page, we bordered a button with red color with the order of instruction so that users can easily follow the instruction. So, compared to using original POS UI to learn, users can easily follow what to do in a given situation. There are some comments that description for this (follow the red border) is insufficient, so we added a dialog before starting each tutorial and the part that users should click the button with red buttons is emphasized with red letters. Therefore, the user can recognize what to do on this page within very short time periods.

For minor usability issues, which are not related to our solution still important for our interface, we first added BACK button on both tutorial mode and game mode so that users can return back to the home page if they don't want to do the process. To avoid accidental returning, we ask "Are you sure?" after clicking back button. (Denoted as 11 as above figures) Plus, we found that there are two types of users after the game mode via user testing: who want to check their ranking or want to finish next levels quickly. To satisfy all of them, we made a popup after completing the task with selections to move to rank or home. (8 at the above) Finally, at the ranking page, to avoid users to return back to each level to check the task, we briefly explained what the task was at each level and the first place of each level (12, 13 at the above). (699 words)

### Iteration

During DP8 period we mainly focused on two things. First one is changing UI of home page. Our previous home page design was poor, and there were many people who did not know the existence of the history page, so we chaged the home page disign to solve these problems.
![](./Images/homepage_before.png)
The above image is our previous homepage. With our previous design, it is hard to notice that user can have tutorial for each level before doing main game. We change our design to make people clear the main game after tutorial with ladder and door image. Also, after the stage was cleared, we make a new ladder connect to the next door to increase the user's sence of accomplishment.

Second one is bug fix and increasing usability for better end-to-end experience. Our prototype was inconvenient to use. User can proceed our prototype without any bugs if they follow our instructions. However, if user run it in a slightly different way, some bugs came out. Moreover, the tutorial page did not have a description of the task, so user could not figure out what the user was doing, and there was no way to get out of the game and tutorial pages if user wanted to quit. There are also some minor problems such as, hard to distinguish between ice and hot. We fixed these problems so that our prototype worked under any situations, and we also improved visibility, affordability, to makee our prototype easier for users to use without any instructions.

During the iteration, we found that it was very difficult for users to be aware of our intentions, and to make user knowtice our intention it needs to be much more intuitive and easier to do than we think.

### Individual reflection
#### Sangmin Lee
During the design project, our team actively exchanged ideas and came up with many good ideas. In my case, two of my team members were friends with Ethiopia. Also, the other person had a close friend who was close to other team members and had no inconvenience to talk together. In addition, our team was well served. Each DP was able to quickly decide on what we had to do, distribute them efficiently, and perform their roles quickly. Also, in the presence of some opinions, the process of gathering them together was quick. They conveyed their thoughts very logically to other members of the team, and their team members logically conveyed their thoughts to them, narrowing the gap of opinions and easily unifying them with one opinion. Based on these points, we think we got good results in early DP.

However, there was a bit of a disappointment at the implementation stage. Everyone was busy because the midterm exam ended and many tasks overlapped. Also, I thought that I could design 4 kinds of pages of POS page, HOME page, RANKING page, and HISTORY page and connect them to each other, so I decided to do their own work rather than spend a lot of time on implementation. I did. At the time of submission of Hi-fi prototyping, our prototype was not complete enough that it would not be strange if a bug appears when user did not follow the given instruction.
To improve the completeness of our prototype, we modified the prototype at the time remaining based on feedback, observation results, and bugs we found. Before Hi-fi prototyping and final demo, we synthesized the feedbacks of the tester and the errors we have found so far and divided them into the seriousness of the problem and the possibility of solving it. Because it was the end of the semester, I decided to inform the chat room that I had to fix the bugs in the KakaoTalk group chat room, fix the bugs at each remaining time, and finish the problem because their schedule was too different to solve. As a result of modifying bugs and inconvenient functions, we were able to improve usability and completeness of prototype.

I learned a lot while proceeding with this design project. First of all, before this semester, I didn't know any concept of user-centered design, so I poured without complaint about the inconvenient website that I sometimes used. However, as I developed myself, I realized how difficult it is for a user to use it without any inconvenience. While we were working on the design project, we were thinking of the user-centered approach, and at the moment it came to the developer's point of view with a focus on functionality. In addition, I have found that users who spend a lot of time and effort trying to convey the intent of the developer to the user are completely obsessed with the user, In addition to user-centered design, I was able to experience web development through this design project. Since there was no experience in web development before, the initial implementation phase focused on simple functions or css for team members, but gradually became familiar with how to use React, and was able to implement new functions and bug fixes during iteration period. In addition to the programmatic elements, I felt the difference of thinking about the design among the team members and the difference of the implementation method, and I was able to understand the advantages and cautions to be gained through the team project.

My feelings towards CS374 is really ambivalent. It is similar to a love-hate relationship. I loved the well-organized contents we discussed and learned in the lecture, the professor's lecture, and the studio with the fantastic TA and other great teams. At the same time, I had a hard time preparing quizzes every class, doing programming assignments with javascript, and designing and implementing a web-based interface to redesign the experience of target users. I learned a lot during this course but I knew that I also had many difficult and hard moments. This was the same in our team Ogogada. My close friends took the HCI course in 2017 and I decided to take it future. However, in 2018, I took an operating system which is one of the toughest course in KAIST CS. Thus, I really wanted to take HCI this year and I gathered team members. Before midterm, I think our team did great teamwork. We met and discussed a lot. Since one member had taken CS473, which is quite similar to this course, he kept the direction of our discussion and thoughts in the right way. I felt a lot in doing needfinding, ideation, and paper prototyping(DP1,2,3). First, those tasks were first to me and I knew that they are similarly important like real implementation. Also, I liked the way we decide the target user, generate HMW questions and make solution ideas. Finally, through making a paper prototype and testing it, we could find some nice insights into our prototype. 

Unfortunately and naturally, we had some points in design projects that we did not work well. It was the first CS course that 4 people did a team project. We should always think about final implementation during the early DP. Also in implementation, it was difficult for 4 people to divide their parts. I tried to use git professionally as people works at the company but eventually, we just pull and push carefully in the master branch. It was doubtful whether our division in implementation tasks was the best decision because we didn't fully understand the level of each other's web programming skills. After all, I was responsible for a little React tasks and most of the CSS tasks. Honestly, I felt CSS as annoying and trivial tasks before this project. However, I learned that well-organized CSS makes the web beautiful and gives programmers insight into CSS. Now, I want to learn more about web programming and CSS such as SCSS and redux in React. During the prototyping process, I recognized how difficult it is to release a bug-free and stable web service. It had a lot of bugs after hi-fi prototyping, and I needed to fix it in the exam period. After midterm we did not meet much more than before, we tried to organize and distribute the tasks we had to do in KakaoTalk chat room. We did not come up with a bug-free and stable prototype in DP6 and I was disappointed with that. But before the Demo, the team worked together to fix bugs and make the HOME page visually better than before, and produce satisfactory results and I am proud of our final work.

Before the design process in HCI, I was only interested in backend programming. However, during this course, I realized that it is important to make products that users want rather than make functionally good. There are a lot of different users in the world, and I think it is fun to iterate the process of making products for target users, getting feedback by doing user testing and complementing the product. In addition, I learned how to set a better direction together in the process of frequent discussions with the team. In web-based GUI implementation, I got the user-centered view. Also, I was interested in creating a user-friendly GUI and I want to do in mobile in the near future. Through this course, I had a great experience with our nice team members, and I would like to express my deep gratitude to the professor and TA for working hard for us.

During working as part of a team, I tried to be flexible depending on situations to support some aspects my team might be missing. After dividing some tasks for the implementation, I tried to balance the burden when other teammates needed more hand for their tasks by doing subtask of theirs such as "popping up dialog". During modifying the app for final iteration, we felt visual aspects were somehow not satisfying because we had focused on implementing functions without errors. Therefore I decided to design some buttons and the background to improve visual aspects, interest users and help users grab the process of "tutorial", "game", or "rank" in faster way. Doors are for starting "game". Ladders are for "tutorial" function to climb up to those doors. Trophy is for checking "rank".

After designing those, to make the image icons seem more like buttons, I added "blink" features to change opacity of them when users tab any other space except clickable spots. 
Yoonseo took part in recording the simulation of our app and I recorded the rest(~00:08, 1:39~2:00), made some illustrations to connect parts, and shared some tasks for editing the video.

Since all of our teammates were busy by attending CS330 or preparing for graduation admission, we could not meet up together that much. Although we met when needed, we used messengers as well to keep the work going. I think this is not an optimal way for teamwork but it worked because all of us had similar level of competence and willingness to keep up the work. Working teamwork with different priorities is difficult to handle. But in my experience, being someone who doesn’t exist in team is a good solution. If my team doesn’t have a designer, I should be the one. If my teammates are busy at certain time, then I try to work more at that period of time. After taking this course, it is highly likely that I would be working as part of a team, not alone. This course helped me to be a better person for teamwork and gave me some lessons. If I be part of a team for work next time, I would try to share time, have talk and share ideas to be more interactive to not feel like work.

This was the first time making something useful for someone else. It was fun and felt good to be helpful to somebody using my abilities. During the initial process like needfinding, I felt the process was little fast for me and other teammates. I think specifying the directions is the first important step because after that we should go deeper for implementing prototypes. In order for clearifying the concept, I learned that I should collect as much information as I can from target users because "knowledge is power"! Different users have common difficulties but have different understandings and behaviors. So understanding them in wide range is an important requirement prior to implementation. Also, I learned the importance of lo-fi prototype, because it is cost-efficient but gives the general flow in the beginning. For hi-fi prototype, I had experienced implementing a native app with "React Native" and it helped be implementing the prototype with "React". During the iterations it was fun to try out various modules but I learned that implementation depends on finding out what I wanted. If that doesn't exist, I should compromise or make something myself. Since there were processes like building lo-fi and mid-fi prototypes, designing an web-based design was much easier even though it was my first time desiging an web. However I did not know much about what was possible to implement and what was hard. The experience of actual implementation web will help me next time when I actually participate in UI/UX design, because I now get the sense of how web design works.

For me, I have taken a very similar course in the last semester: CS473, Intro to Social Computing. Therefore, I was quite confident about the design project process since most milestones are similar to the thing that I’ve done before. Not only my experience in the design process, but other teammates also worked very hard and consumed a lot of time during the semester. For these reasons, I think we got the right direction about what to do faster than others, by doing a lot of interviews and try to set 3 solutions for our selected problem. As a result, we finally got ‘Most Human-Centered Awards’ at the last class, and we got perfect scores at the first few DP milestones. ‘Rather than focusing on making perfect service, try to find and implement 3 solutions to solve our problem’ is the thing that we worked well I think. 

The thing that we didn’t work well is implementation. I thought I can finish implementing our UI very fast since our UI required a few things to do compared to the service that I implemented on CS473. Plus, two of us (I and Seongha) had an experience on web programming, we thought everything would go well. However, there were some unexpected problems while implementing the UI. As a result, honestly, our prototype had bad usability and had some errors until the deadline of the hi-fi prototype. Furthermore, I was taking Operating System course and Advance ML course at the same time in this semester (one of the time-consuming courses), so it was really hard to consume a lot of time on design project after the midterm compares to the previous semester CS473. Not only me, but others also have a different plan and some of them are busy to prepare their graduation. So it was hard to meet and implement UI together on the offline after the midterm. To solve this implementation problem, we derived 2 solutions. First of all, we often summarized some errors and issues that we need to solve and determined who will solve such issues on KakaoTalk group chat room, just I had done in CS473 design projects. For lack of usability on hi-fi prototype issue, we got a lot of feedback from TAs, and test users, then we consumed a lot of time to apply those feedbacks from the problem. Finally, we finally got the UI with high, nice usability on final class demo sessions.

Since it was the second time for doing this design process and web programming, I learned a lot by comparison with the initial project that I've done in the previous semester. The first thing that I learn is, there's no perfect solution that can be applied to all user-centered design. For instance, we tried to make the different QnA platform in the previous semester, and most users are considering only 'Asking' and 'Answering' at the questions, the design should be simple and only a few buttons SHOULD be required. However, this semester, since we were trying to make the platform that users can learn the POS efficiently, too much simplification or abstraction had some side-effects since in the learning process different users have different viewpoints and understanding while learning. Therefore, we needed to think 'How to give information efficiently to users' rather than 'Simplification on UI'. Even the broad topic of my two design projects are related to 'Education' (QnA or Learning platform) the focusing point and solutions that I needed to think to have a lot of difference. So I learned it is important to see and analyze the given problem very deeply with lots of studies to make a real user-centered UI. Plus, I'm happy to learn and know some useful libraries such as React-semantic-UI for better .css format handling, since in previous semester there's no guide about this so we only used pure .css format for design. I think is the biggest and useful thing that I learned for web-based GUI implementation throughout this course this semester. Very thankful for TAs, professors and my teammates to have such nice experience during the whole semester!
