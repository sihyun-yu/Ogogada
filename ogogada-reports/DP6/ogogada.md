## Team Ogogada
Sangmin Lee, Yoonseo Kim, Sungha Eom, and Sihyun Yu

### POV
A new cafe part-time job worker 
needs to <strong> practice a lot and quickly get familiar with POS </strong> because <strong> most new workers are at the complex device POS, but there’s no explicit instructions or guides for that and he/she doesn’t want to be embarrassed at sudden situations. </strong>
