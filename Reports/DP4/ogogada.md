# [DP4] Lo-fi Prototyping

## Team Ogogada
Sangmin Lee, Yoonseo Kim, Sungha Eom, and Sihyun Yu

**We modified the task 3 and did user testing with modified prototype and tasks.**

### Experience
We want to redesign experiences of training for new cafe part-time job workers.

### POV
A new cafe part-time job worker 
needs to <strong> practice a lot and quickly get familiar with POS </strong> because <strong> most new workers are at the complex device POS, but there’s no explicit instructions or guides for that and he/she doesn’t want to be embarrassed at sudden situations. </strong>

### Tasks
Since we want to let the user practice POS feeling like playing game, we asked for test users to follow the 3 tasks below.

1. Watch the history of how to use POS at level 4 (using Gifticon at the situation).
2. Do the task at level 4 with a few mistakes (allows low accuracy) and level up to 5.
3. After playing the game, check out your rank at level 4.

### Prototype


### Observations

### Digital

We used Sketch and Invision as a prototyping tool.

First of all, they provided a familiar platform that we usually have used such as iOS UI or Android UI. Furthermore, the layer system was very similar to the one in Photoshop, so it was quite easy to get used of this platform. Also, the homepages offer detailed instructions. Lastly, we are so fascinated the program visualizes hotspots very well between screen to screen.
