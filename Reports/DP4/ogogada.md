# [DP4] Lo-fi Prototyping

## Team Ogogada
Sangmin Lee, Yoonseo Kim, Sungha Eom, and Sihyun Yu

**We modified the task 3 and did user testing with modified prototype and tasks.**

### Experience
We want to redesign experiences of training for new cafe part-time job workers.

### POV
A new cafe part-time job worker 
needs to <strong> practice a lot and quickly get familiar with POS </strong> because <strong> most new workers are at the complex device POS, but there’s no explicit instructions or guides for that and he/she doesn’t want to be embarrassed at sudden situations. </strong>

### Tasks
Since we want to let the user practice POS feeling like playing game, we asked for test users to follow the 3 tasks below.

1. Watch the history of how to use POS at level 4 (using Gifticon at the situation).
2. Do the task at level 4 with a few mistakes (allows low accuracy) and level up to 5.
3. After playing the game, check out your rank at level 4.

### Prototype


### Observations

### Digital

We used Sketch and Invision as a prototyping tool.

First of all, they provided a familiar platform that we usually have used such as iOS UI or Android UI. Furthermore, the layer system was very similar to the one in Photoshop, so it was quite easy to get used of this platform. Also, the homepages offer detailed instructions. Lastly, we are so fascinated the program visualizes hotspots very well between screen to screen.

### Studio Reflection
There were many feedbacks after the studio. We summarzied these and some of these are reflected before the user test. 
 
> I like your team make your prototype as a game so that user can achieve their tasks step by step.

We were happy that the purpose of our prototype was well shown, and tried to more focus on gamification suah as ranking system in our further low fi prototype before user testing. 

> 15SQuad/Doheon: I wish the accuracy decrease animation would not disturb the user too much when doing the task.

The purpose of this is to emphasize users about accuracy decrease. However, we agree that this will disturb users to use the prototype comfortable. For mid fi and high fi prototype, we'll decrease the animation for this. 

> I wish the goal/task is shown with bigger font. It’s very hard to find what the user is expected to do. Popup in the beginning of the page would be another good alternative.

We also agree with this. The original purpose of our prototype was just listening the order one time to simulate real situation to users, but since this is for an educational purpose, this might be unnecessary. We will talk this more with our teammates and users. 

> I wish the accuracy of the completed levels are shown on the level screen. 

This is a really good idea. We can add this on further prototypes. 

> I wish there could be a way such as jump so that user who already know lower level may go to higher level immediately.

Also agree with this and we can implement this with further prototype. Visualizing the movement of character would be very important users to understand the system of our prototype. 

> How can we know the correct answer for each stage? It will be better with correct instructions which helps users doing his own.

We can check the basic order with given goal at the history list, and the purpose of the real game is to get familiar with more complicated situation compared to showing history. Therefroe, our decision is not to show the answer for the real stage since the purpose of the real stage is get used to POS without real answer.
