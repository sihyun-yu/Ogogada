# [DP2] Ideation Report

## Team Ogogada
Sangmin Lee, Yoonseo Kim, Sungha Eom, and Sihyun Yu

### Experience
We want to redesign experiences of training for new cafe part-time job workers.

### POV : Point of View

Based on needs and insights from DP1 and in-class-activity, we have decided our one most compelling POV

> **A new cafe part-time job worker** needs to 
**practice a lot and quickly get familiar with POS** because **most new workers are at the complex device POS, but there’s no explicit instructions or guides for that and she doesn’t want to be embarrassed at sudden situations.**

### Persona

To help with prototyping and specifc implementation, we have picked one persona.

> * name: Soojeong Lee

> * gender: Female
> * position: Gwangju
> * experience: 2 weeks

* STORY
Soojung Lee is a university student who moved a house a few months ago. During the summer break, she tries to save the money for the trip with her friends. Therefore, she decides to earn money by doing cafe part-time job. Since she moved her house a few months ago, a cafe that she works is very new for her and of course there’s no friends at the cafe. Plus, it was the first time for her working at the cafe. She makes a lot of mistake at POS while working, and this makes her so stressful. 

* MOTIVATION
She needs money for travel, wants to make a new friend at the new place, and she thought cafe part-time job looks so fun.

Practice makes perfect. 
I must be perfect at any situation.

Be perfect for working and not to be embarrassed at sudden, new situation at the cafe.

### HMW : How might we...

### Solution Ideas

### Storyboards

### Studio Reflections

- There are many good comments about our presentation. First of all, many people noted that they liked the details of our persona. Those specific details made the persona more realistic.

> We thought of our persona through various interviews and based on that we found out some common characteristics among the interviewees. Then we picked some details that strongly relates to our POV.

- In contrast, there were also some comments about specifying the solutions. And one peer actually made a suggestion for one of our 3 solutions, which is 'visualizing past history'. 

> When we were thinking of the second solution, which is 'showing POS history for some situations', we talked about that as well, which just came out of our mind. For real implementation and testing for further process, we also think it is a great idea and as far as nothing changes we look forward to trying implementing it.

- The third solution, which is 'Showing ranks of specific rounds' was questioned by one of our peers. He is worring about whether it actually can motivate new part-time workers to practice. He also mentioned Korea education system, which emphasizes rankings but deters the motives for studying.

> Our intention was to encourage new part-time workers. Because even if they don't play well at first, they don't lose anything or get punished. But they would feel great when they finally play well. But we realized that the point given is still a crucial point that we have to care about until implementing the solution.

- For minor comment, some liked the storyboards and how we approached the HMW questions.

> We kept up the criteria given in course website, and that helped us a lot.
