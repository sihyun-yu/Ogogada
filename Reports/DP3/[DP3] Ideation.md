### Studio Reflections

- There are many good comments about our presentation. First of all, many people noted that they liked the details of our persona. Those specific details made the persona more realistic.

> We thought of our persona through various interviews and based on that we found out some common characteristics among the interviewees. Then we picked some details that strongly relates to our POV.

- In contrast, there were also some comments about specifying the solutions. And one peer actually made a suggestion for one of our 3 solutions, which is 'visualizing past history'. 

> When we were thinking of the third solution, which is 'POS histories which show nice answer of certain special situations', we talked about that as well, which just came out of our mind. For real implementation and testing for further process, we also think it is a great idea and as far as nothing changes we look forward to trying implementing it.

- The second solution, which is 'Showing ranks of specific rounds' was questioned by one of our peers. He is worring about whether it actually can motivate new part-time workers to practice. He also mentioned Korea education system, which emphasizes rankings but deters the motives for studying.

> Our intention was to encourage new part-time workers. Because even if they don't play well at first, they don't lose anything or get punished. But they would feel great when they finally play well and rank on higher place. However, we realized that the point given is still a crucial point that we have to care about until implementing the solution.

- For minor comment, some liked the storyboards and how we approached the HMW questions.

> We kept up the criteria given in course website, and that helped us a lot.
