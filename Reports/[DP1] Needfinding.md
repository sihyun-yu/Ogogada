# [DP1] Needfinding Report

## Team Ogogada
Sangmin Lee, Yoonseo Kim, Sungha Eom, and Sihyun Yu

### Experience
We want to redesign experiences of training for new cafe part-time job workers.

### Observation & Interviews

We asked the following questions to the people who have an experience working at cafe. We tried to vary the duration, the number of worked cafes  for each interviewees.

> 1. How long did you work at the cafe?
> 2. Do you have any experience to teach someone with working at cafe?
> 3. Any experience to be embarassed while working at the cafe at the first time?
> 4. What was the method for you to learn how to work at the cafe?
> 5. Do you have any mistakes while working at the cafe? Why?
> 6. How did you do for the mistake? Any good way to prevent the similar mistake?

This is the summary of our interviewees. 

(sorted with the duration and the number of cafe, 1~5 are people who worked at only one cafe, 6~9 worked at more than 1 cafe).

#### Interesting Moments

Based on interviews and observation, we found some interesting moments about our problem.

* POS uncomfortable for payment & revision

>> ![](./Images/pos1.png)
>> There are so many buttons in POS UI
>> ![](./Images/pos2.png)
>> Therefore, it is hard to know the meaning of each button
>> ![](./Images/pos3.png)
>> 
>> Usually, workers need to add additional post-it to justify these 

* Buy when they made wrong menus
* Be tested for studying menus with homepage or videos

>> ![](./Images/hp1.png)
>> New workers need to memorize all of information in the webpage
>> ![](./Images/hp2.png)
>> Sometimes, it is still hard to distinguish menus since they have similar appearance in real 

* Managers watch workers through CCTVs
* Not only managers but also proficient part-time workers educate new part-time workers

### Needs
* Look up what to do if they do not know at a certain situation
* Practice POS even if no people are ordering the menu
* Do not miss the list of orders while making menus
* Match the correct menu for every customer
* Give a list of recommendations to users 
* Provide a priority of menus to be made
* Know how much cups can be made at once for each menu
* Check all of the questions while taking the order
* Memorize all of the recipes of the menus
* Do not want to be embarrassed while facing various types of people

### Insights 

* There are many non-specific instructions and even some parts are omitted.
* Each store has different education method.
* Remembering the location of the material on the first day is still confusing, even if they have previous experience at another cafe.
* The experienced people are better able to respond to sudden situations
* Learn POS first, when they start a part-time job.
* Unlike bakery, they can work without memorizing all the menus.
* It is not easy to practice every menu because of monetary problems and time problems.
* A variety of situations occurs.
* Depending on the type of job, it may be better to do the job with the written recipe or may be better to learn by doing.
* Beginners are embarrassed when a lot of menus are ordered at once.

### Studio Reflections

- There are many good comments about our presentation. First of all, many people noted that we tried to find and analyze the situation and information deeply, and tried to point out notable, important points among these. 

> We thought this is our team's strength and we will try to keep this strength for further design project milestones. 

- In contrast, there were also some comments about specifying the type of cafe. Since each cafe has different characteristics (like includes/not includes bakery), so someone points out that it will be better to specify this for later milestones. 

> We also agree with this. For real implementation and testing for further process, it will be so hard to generalize all the cafes in one semester. Based on the information we got, we are planning to specify the cafe for making lofi or midfi prototype. 

- There also was a question that whether the structure of POS UI is different for each cafe even if the cafe is the same franchise. 

> We haven't considered about this and considering and knowing this will be helpful to our design project. We will ask more various people from other regions to check this. 

- For minor comment, someone commented that some parts of our presentation were a little bit fast so that hard to follow. 

> We realized this, and will more try to present with listener's perspective.
