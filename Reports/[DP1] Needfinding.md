* Used Facetalk for interview
* Very new part-time job worker
* Had trouble to memorize so many types of breads and beverages 
* Hard to get used of the position of drinks at POS 
* Always think POS is too complicated to easily use
* Too many people at the same time make she so embarassed and lead some mistakes: did not check the expire date of coupon, ot Americano to ice Americano, entered wrong menu at POS...


#### 2. Grapefruit Tea - Worked at 2 Cafes (14 months) - By Sihyun Yu
![](./images/sihyun_3.png)

* Due to the distance limitation, used Facebook messanger for interview
* Feel difference between paper recipe and doing the recipe in real
* Has experience mismatching the menu because of recipe confusion
* Recipe mistake disappeared as doing the part-time job for a long time
* Learned most things from the cafe manager 

#### 3. Americano - Worked at Dunkin Donuts (3 months) - By Sihyun Yu

* Used Kakaotalk for interview
* Work with the POS at the first time, since not familiar with making drinks
* POS was so complicated and confused at the first time
* Often forget some questions to ask such as point collection
* Cannot ask at question of customers like menu recommodations, since she don't know either
* Too many orders at the same time makes her to forget some lists, or forget to putting something while making the drink
* Feel difference between real experience and verval/text guides


### Needs
* Look up what to do if they do not know at a certain situation

* Practice POS even if no people are ordering the menu

* Do not miss the list of orders while making menus

* Match the correct menu for every customer

* Give a list of recommendations to users 

* Provide a priority of menus to be made

* Know how much cups can be made at once for each menu

* Check all of the questions while taking the order

* Memorize all of the recipes of the menus

* Do not want to be embarrassed while facing various types of people

### Insights 

* There are many non-specific instructions and even some parts are omitted.

* Each store has different education method.

* Remembering the location of the material on the first day is still confusing, even if they have previous experience at another cafe.

* The experienced people are better able to respond to sudden situations

* Learn POS first, when they start a part-time job.

* Unlike bakery, they can work without memorizing all the menus.

* It is not easy to practice every menu because of monetary problems and time problems.

* A variety of situations occurs.

* Depending on the type of job, it may be better to do the job with the written recipe or may be better to learn by doing.

* Beginners are embarrassed when a lot of menus are ordered at once.

### Studio Reflections

- There are many good comments about our presentation. First of all, many people noted that we tried to find and analyze the situation and information deeply, and tried to point out notable, important points among these. 

> We thought this is our team's strength and we will try to keep this strength for further design project milestones. 

- In contrast, there were also some comments about specifying the type of cafe. Since each cafe has different characteristics (like includes/not includes bakery), so someone points out that it will be better to specify this for later milestones. 

> We also agree with this. For real implementation and testing for further process, it will be so hard to generalize all the cafes in one semester. Based on the information we got, we are planning to specify the cafe for making lofi or midfi prototype. 

- There also was a question that whether the structure of POS UI is different for each cafe even if the cafe is the same franchise. 

> We haven't considered about this and considering and knowing this will be helpful to our design project. We will ask more various people from other regions to check this. 

- For minor comment, someone commented that some parts of our presentation were a little bit fast so that hard to follow. 

> We realized this, and will more try to present with listener's perspective.
