# [DP1] Needfinding Report

## Team Ogogada
Sangmin Lee, Yoonseo Kim, Sungha Eom, and Sihyun Yu

### Experience
We want to edesign experiences of training for new cafe part-time job workers.

### Observation & Interviews

### Needs
* Look up what to do if they do not know at the certain situation

* Practice POS even if no people are ordering the menu

* Do not miss the list of orders while making menus

* Match a correct menu for every customer

* Give a list of recommendations to users 

* Provide a priority of menus to be made

* Know how much cups can be made at once for each menu

* Check all of questions while taking the order

* Memorize all of recipes of the menus

* Do not want to be embarrassed while facing various types of people

### Insights 

* There are many non-specific instructions and even some parts are omitted.

* Each store has different education method.

* Remembering the location of the material on the first day is still confusing, even if they have previous experience at another cafe.

* The experienced people are better able to respond to sudden situations

* Learn POS first, when they start part-time job.

* Unlike bakery, they can work without memorizing all the menus.

* It is not easy to practice every menu because of monetary problems and time problems.

* A variety of situations occurs.

* Depending on the type of job, it may be better to do job with written recipe or may be better to learn by doing.

* Beginners are embarrassed when a lot of menus are ordered at once.

### Studio Reflections (Need to be summarized)
#### I like â€¦
15SQuad / Eunho: I like that you find many interviewees with variety.
WARdrobe/Vagif: I very much like the presentation. Lots of pictures with a nice reference makes it interesting and easily understandable 

Gimme/Lixia: I like how you interviewed many different experienced people and showing all different kinds of the photos.

JAKY/Seonghyeon: I like that you highlighted some key words from the slide. 

Wardrobe/Kamal: I liked the depth of the research meaning the wide range of cafes

#### I wish ...
15SQuad / Taehyung: I wish you talk more slowly in the beginning of presentation(interesting mment part). It was little bit hard to follow. 

> Ogogada/sungha: Oh that part was mine, sorry for that :)

> Ogogada/Sihyun: We will consider more about this for further presenatations. Sorry for that T.T

15SQuad/Doheon: I wish your team can specify the type of cafe; bakery, coffee, or cafes that serve both.
Ogogada/Sihyun : Thank you good comment ! 

#### Others

15SQuad / Eunho: I have some concern that the UI - the format or structure of POS might be different for each cafe, even if the cafe is franchise. I am so curious that how do you solve this problem if you give some kind of guide for this POS UI.
